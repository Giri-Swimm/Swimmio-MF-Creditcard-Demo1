title: Modify Transaction Types (MNTTRDB2)
---
This document explains the MNTTRDB2 batch job that manages transaction types in the DB2 database. It processes bulk input files to add, update, or delete transaction types, ensuring the transaction table stays current. For example, if the input file contains a command to add a new transaction type, the job inserts it into the table.
